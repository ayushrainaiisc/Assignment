    "Different Types of Methods used to prevent Overfitting are discussed below\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Split Data : We should split our data set in 2 parts, both for training and testing purposes. Most commonly we use 80% data set for training purposes and 20% data for testing Purposes. We train our model until it performs well not only on the training set but also for the testing set. This indicates good generalization capability since the testing set represents unseen data that were not used for training. However, this approach would require a sufficiently large dataset to train on even after splitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Early stopping: This technique stops the training process when the model starts to overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Cross-validation: This technique evaluates the performance of a model by splitting the data into multiple folds and training the model on each fold while testing it on the remaining folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Data augmentation: This technique increases the size of the training data by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to the existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Feature Selection : If we have only a limited amount of training samples, each with a large number of features, we should only select the most important features for training so that our model doesn’t need to learn for so many features and eventually overfit.\n",

    "The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that refers to the tradeoff between the bias and variance of a model. Bias refers to the error that is introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simpler model, while variance refers to the error that is introduced by the model’s sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data. A model with high bias will underfit the data, while a model with high variance will overfit the data. The goal is to find the right balance between bias and variance to achieve the best performance on new, unseen data. This can be achieved by tuning the model’s complexity, regularization strength, or other hyperparameters"

    "In machine learning, bias and variance are two critical concepts that affect the performance of a model. Bias refers to the difference between the expected prediction of the model and the correct value. High bias implies that the model is not complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data, leading to underfitting. On the other hand, variance refers to the sensitivity of the model to small fluctuations in the training data, leading to overfitting. High variance implies that the model is overly complex and memorizes the training data instead of learning the underlying patterns. Therefore, a good model should balance bias and variance to achieve optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "High bias models typically have low complexity and are unable to capture the underlying patterns in the data. Examples of high bias models include linear regression, which assumes a linear relationship between the input and output variables. Another example is a decision tree with few nodes, which is too simplistic to capture complex relationships in the data. High bias models tend to underfit the data and have poor accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, high variance models are too complex and tend to overfit the data by memorizing the training set instead of learning the underlying patterns. Examples of high variance models include deep neural networks with many layers and nodes, which are prone to overfitting if not regularized. Another example is a decision tree with many nodes, which can capture complex relationships but may also overfit. High variance models tend to have high accuracy on the training data but perform poorly on the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve optimal performance, a good model should balance bias and variance by adjusting its complexity or regularization techniques. For example, adding more features or increasing the number of layers in a neural network can reduce bias but increase variance, while regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization can reduce variance but increase bias."

    "Regularization : Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of a model. It does this by adding a penalty term to the loss function that discourages the model from learning complex patterns that may not generalize well to new data\n",

L1 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the absolute value of the model weights, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term that is proportional to the square of the model weights. L2 regularization is more commonly used than L1 regularization"
