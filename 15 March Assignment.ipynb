    "Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation\n",
    "\n",
    "AI has many applications in various fields, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment. Some examples of AI-powered technologies include virtual assistants, self-driving cars, and facial recognition systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some AI are designed in such a way that they can make decisions on their own without any human interaction.\n",
    "Such AI systems can be both beneficial and dangerous to us, but this depends on a number of factors\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2) Machine Learning\n",
    "Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that allow computer systems to learn from data and improve their performance on a specific task over time, without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, the computer system is given a dataset and is trained to recognize patterns and make predictions based on that data. As the system processes more data, it adjusts its algorithms and models to improve its accuracy and performance.\n",

    "# 3) Deep Learning\n",
    "Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks, which are modeled after the structure and function of the human brain, to learn from large amounts of data. These neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes or \"neurons\" that process and analyze data, and the connections between these neurons are weighted to determine their impact on the final output.\n",

    "Supervised machine learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained using labeled data, meaning the data comes with known input-output pairs. The algorithm learns to recognize patterns in the input data and predict the correct output based on that learning. The goal is to generalize this learning to new, unseen data.\n",

    "In machine learning, it is common practice to split a dataset into three subsets: training set, validation set, and test set. Here is an explanation of each subset and its importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Training set: The training set is a subset of the dataset used to train the machine learning model. It contains input data and the corresponding output or \"label\" for each data point. The model learns from this data by adjusting its internal parameters to minimize the error between the predicted output and the true output.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Validation set: The validation set is a subset of the dataset used to evaluate the performance of the model during training. It is also used to increase the accuracy of our model\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Test set: The test set is a subset of the dataset used to evaluate the final performance of the model after training is complete. It is used to estimate the generalization error of the model, which is the error rate when the model is applied to new, unseen data\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, train-test-validation split is a crucial step in machine learning to ensure that the model is trained, validated, and tested on different subsets of the data.\n",
